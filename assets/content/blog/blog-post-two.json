Leo was the last of a series of emperors placed on the throne by[Aspar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspar \"Aspar\"), the[Alan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alans \"Alans\")serving as commander-in-chief of the army, who thought Leo would be an easy[puppet ruler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_ruler \"Puppet ruler\"). Instead, Leo became more and more independent from Aspar, causing tension that would culminate in the assassination of the latter.\n\nLeo's[coronation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation \"Coronation\")as emperor on 7 February 457,[\\[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_the_Thracian#cite_note-10)[\\[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_the_Thracian#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBury1958-1)was the first known to involve the[Patriarch of Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenical_Patriarch_of_Constantinople \"Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople\").[\\[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_the_Thracian#cite_note-11)Leo I made an alliance with the[Isaurians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isauria \"Isauria\")and was thus able to eliminate Aspar. The price of the alliance was the marriage of Leo's daughter to Tarasicodissa, leader of the Isaurians, who, as[Zeno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_(emperor) \"Zeno (emperor)\"), became emperor in 474. In 469, Aspar attempted to assassinate Zeno[\\[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_the_Thracian#cite_note-12)and very nearly succeeded. Finally, in 471, Aspar's son[Ardabur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardabur_(consul_447) \"Ardabur (consul 447)\")was implicated in a plot against Leo but was killed by palace[eunuchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunuch \"Eunuch\")acting on Leo's orders.[\\[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_the_Thracian#cite_note-13)\n\nLeo sometimes overestimated his abilities and made mistakes that threatened the internal order of the Empire. The[Balkans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_peninsula \"Balkan peninsula\")were ravaged by the[Ostrogoths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrogoths \"Ostrogoths\"), after a disagreement between the Emperor and the young chief[Theodoric the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodoric_the_Great \"Theodoric the Great\"), who had been raised at Leo's court in Constantinople, where he was steeped in Roman government and military tactics. There were also some raids by the[Huns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huns \"Huns\"). However, these attackers were unable to take[Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople \"Constantinople\")thanks to the[walls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walls_of_Constantinople \"Walls of Constantinople\"), which had been rebuilt and reinforced in the reign of[Theodosius II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_II \"Theodosius II\")and against which they possessed no suitable[siege engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_engine \"Siege engine\").\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Solidus-Leo_I-RIC_0605.7.jpg/300px-Solidus-Leo_I-RIC_0605.7.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Solidus-Leo_I-RIC_0605.7.jpg)\n\n[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Solidus-Leo_I-RIC_0605.7.jpg \"Enlarge\")\n\nGold[solidus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidus_(coin) \"Solidus (coin)\")of Leo I, struck 462–473 AD at Constantinople.\n\nLeo's reign was also noteworthy for his influence in the[Western Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire \"Western Roman Empire\"), marked by his appointment of[Anthemius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthemius \"Anthemius\")as[Western Roman Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Emperor \"Western Roman Emperor\")in 467. He attempted to build on this political achievement with an expedition against the[Vandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandals \"Vandals\")in 468, which was defeated due to the arrogance of Leo's brother-in-law[Basiliscus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basiliscus \"Basiliscus\"). This disaster drained the Empire of men and money.[Procopius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procopius \"Procopius\")estimated the costs of the expedition to be 130,000 pounds of gold;[John the Lydian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Lydian \"John the Lydian\")estimated the costs to be 65,000 pounds of gold and 750,000 pounds of silver.[\\[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_the_Thracian#cite_note-14)The expedition consisted of 1,113 ships carrying 100,000 men; 600 of these ships were lost during the expedition. After this defeat, the Vandals raided Greek coasts until a costly peace agreement was signed between Leo and Genseric.\n\nLeo became very unpopular in his last days as Emperor for abolishing any non-religious celebration or event on Sundays.[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")*]\n\nLeo died of[dysentery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysentery \"Dysentery\")at the age of 73 on 18 January 474.\n\n## Marriage and children[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leo_I_the_Thracian&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Marriage and children\")]\n\nLeo and Verina had three children. Their eldest daughter[Ariadne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne_(empress) \"Ariadne (empress)\")was born prior to the death of[Marcian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcian \"Marcian\")(reigned 450 – 457).[\\[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_the_Thracian#cite_note-15)Ariadne had a younger sister,[Leontia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leontia_(daughter_of_Leo_I) \"Leontia (daughter of Leo I)\"). Leontia was first betrothed to[Patricius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricius_(Caesar) \"Patricius (Caesar)\"), a son of Aspar, but their engagement was probably annulled when Aspar and another of his sons, Ardabur, were assassinated in 471.[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")*]Leontia then married[Marcian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcian_(usurper) \"Marcian (usurper)\"), a son of Emperor[Anthemius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthemius \"Anthemius\")and[Marcia Euphemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcia_Euphemia \"Marcia Euphemia\"). The couple led a failed revolt against Zeno in 478–479. They were exiled to[Isauria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isauria \"Isauria\")following their defeat.[\\[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_the_Thracian#cite_note-ReferenceA-16)\n\nAn unknown son was born in 463. He died five months following his birth. The only sources about him are a[horoscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horoscope \"Horoscope\")by[Rhetorius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetorius \"Rhetorius\")and a[hagiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagiography \"Hagiography\")of[Daniel the Stylite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_the_Stylite \"Daniel the Stylite\").[\\[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_the_Thracian#cite_note-ReferenceA-16)\n\nThe*Georgian Chronicle*, a 13th-century compilation drawing from earlier sources, reports a marriage of[Vakhtang I of Iberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vakhtang_I_of_Iberia \"Vakhtang I of Iberia\")to Princess Helena of Byzantium, identifying her as a daughter of the predecessor of Zeno.[\\[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_the_Thracian#cite_note-17)This predecessor was probably Leo I, the tale attributing a third daughter to Leo.[Cyril Toumanoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Toumanoff \"Cyril Toumanoff\")identified two children of this marriage: Mithridates of Iberia; and Leo of Iberia. This younger Leo was father of[Guaram I of Iberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaram_I_of_Iberia \"Guaram I of Iberia\"). The accuracy of the descent is unknown.\n\n## See also[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leo_I_the_Thracian&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: See also\")]\n\n* ![flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Byzantine_imperial_flag%2C_14th_century%2C_square.svg/28px-Byzantine_imperial_flag%2C_14th_century%2C_square.svg.png)[Byzantine Empire portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Byzantine_Empire \"Portal:Byzantine Empire\")\n* [Church of St. Mary of the Spring (Istanbul)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_St._Mary_of_the_Spring_(Istanbul) \"Church of St. Mary of the Spring (Istanbul)\")\n* [Life-giving Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-giving_Spring \"Life-giving Spring\")\n* [List of Byzantine emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Byzantine_emperors \"List of Byzantine emperors\")\n\n## References[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leo_I_the_Thracian&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: References\")]\n\n1. ^[Jump up to:***a***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_the_Thracian#cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBury1958_1-0)***[b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_the_Thracian#cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBury1958_1-1)***[Bury 1958](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_the_Thracian#CITEREFBury1958).\n2. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_the_Thracian#cite_ref-2 \"Jump up\")**The Inheritance of Rome, Chris Wickham, Penguin Books Ltd. 2009,[ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number \"International Standard Book Number\") [978-0-670-02098-0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0-670-02098-0 \"Special:BookSources/978-0-670-02098-0\")(page 90)\n3. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_I_the_Thracian#cite_ref-3 \"Jump up\")**Great[Synaxaristes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaxarium \"Synaxarium\")(in Greek):*[Ὁ Ἅγιος Λέων Μακέλλης ὁ Μέγας](http://www.synaxarion.gr/gr/sid/1818/sxsaintinfo.aspx).*20 Ιανουαρίου.
